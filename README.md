# Abe - Annotate the bigger picture
Abe helps you build richer training data — capture object hierarchy and relations for complex structured annotations.

A data annotation platform, designed to create richer relational image datasets while reconciling and consolidating evolving data schemas. 👉 [Request a Demo](https://abe-branding.vercel.app/)

Product pain points:
- Existing tools handle classical tasks like object detection but fail for structured key-value extraction in document parsing.
- In practice, schemas evolve and are discovered by labelers—not fixed upfront—yet existing tools don’t support this dynamic process.

<br>

## Known issues:
- Drag & Drop of Annotation Tree panel

## Planned:
- Support for drawing vector shapes 
- Support for auto-generation of shapes from user selections.
- Auto-annotation based on active learning
- Schma reconciliation & consolidation
