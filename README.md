# Abe - Image Annotator for Complex Object Relations

<b>Annotate the bigger picture. </b> 

<br>

Abe helps you build richer training data â€” capture object hierarchy and relations, while managing evolving schemas. ðŸ‘‰ [Request a Demo](https://abe-branding.vercel.app/)

<br>

## Product pain points:
- Existing tools handle classical tasks like object detection but fail for structured key-value extraction in document parsing.
- In practice, data schemas evolve and are continually discovered by labelers â€” not fixed upfront. These need to be reconciled and consolidated.

## Known bugs:
- Drag & Drop of Annotation Tree panel

## Planned features:
- Scene graphs
- Scehma reconciliation & consolidation
