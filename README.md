Abe helps you build richer training data â€” capture object hierarchy and relations for complex structured annotations.

A data annotation platform, designed to create richer relational image datasets while reconciling and consolidating evolving data schemas. ðŸ‘‰ [Request a Demo](https://abe-branding.vercel.app/)

<br>

Product pain points:
- Existing tools handle classical tasks like object detection but fail for structured key-value extraction in document parsing.
- In practice, schemas evolve and are discovered by labelersâ€”not fixed upfrontâ€”yet existing tools donâ€™t support this dynamic process.

## Known issues:
- Drag & Drop of Annotation Tree panel

## Planned features:
- Scene graphs
- Scehma reconciliation & consolidation
